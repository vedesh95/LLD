packages can be dropped to lockers
packages can be of different sizes
various strategies for assigning lockers to packages

generate an access code for a locker when a package is dropped off
while recipient can pick up the package, they must provide the access code
invalid access code should not allow access to the locker


design:
enum SIZE SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE
assignment.AssignmentStrategy.Item - id size
locker.Locker - id size isOccupied accessCode
LockerManager - lockers assignLocker(package) generateAccessCode(locker) validateAccessCode(locker, code) map<lockerId, accesscode>
